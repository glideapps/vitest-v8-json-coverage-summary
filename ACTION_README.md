## Coverage File Format

The action expects a JSON file with the following structure (generated by the vitest-v8-json-coverage-summary reporter):

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "statements": 89.82,
    "branches": 94.29,
    "functions": 58.82,
    "lines": 89.82
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "file": "src/example.ts",
      "statements": 90.84,
      "branches": 91.89,
      "functions": 25,
      "lines": 90.84,
      "uncoveredLines": [39, 40, 45]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example Output

The action creates a comment like this:

```markdown

## Status Indicators

- 🟢 **Green**: Coverage meets or exceeds the threshold
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Coverage is at least 80% of the threshold
- 🔴 **Red**: Coverage is below 80% of the threshold

## Setup with Vitest

1. Install the coverage reporter:

   ```bash
   npm install vitest-v8-json-coverage-summary
   ```

2. Configure vitest to use the reporter:

   ```javascript
   // vitest.config.js
   export default {
     coverage: {
       provider: "v8",
       reporter: ["text", "json-summary"],
       reportsDirectory: "./coverage",
     },
   };
   ```

3. Add the GitHub Action to your workflow as shown above.

## Coverage Badges

When `make-badges` is enabled (default: `true`), the action creates a `badges` directory with shields.io compatible JSON files:

### Generated Badges

- `badges/coverage.json` - Overall coverage percentage
- `badges/statements.json` - Statement coverage
- `badges/branches.json` - Branch coverage
- `badges/functions.json` - Function coverage
- `badges/lines.json` - Line coverage

### Badge Colors

- 🟢 **Bright Green**: 90% or higher
- 🟢 **Green**: 80-89%
- 🟡 **Yellow**: 70-79%
- 🟠 **Orange**: 60-69%
- 🔴 **Red**: Below 60%

### Using Badges with GitHub Pages

The badge upload action automatically uploads badges to your GitHub Pages branch.

**Automatic Setup:**

- Creates the `gh-pages` branch if it doesn't exist
- Uploads badges to the specified directory
- Commits and pushes changes automatically

**Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select your `gh-pages` branch (or the branch specified in `pages-branch`)
4. Set folder to `/ (root)` or `/badges` depending on your preference

**Badge URLs** will be available at:

```
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/coverage.json
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/statements.json
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/branches.json
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/functions.json
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/lines.json
```

**Use in your README.md:**

```markdown
![Coverage](https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/coverage.json)
![Statements](https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/statements.json)
![Branches](https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/branches.json)
```

### Required Permissions

For basic functionality, your workflow needs:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write # For creating/updating PR comments
```

For GitHub Pages deployment, add:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write # For uploading to GitHub Pages
```

## How It Works

The action is built as a **composite action** using pure YAML and shell commands:

1. **File Validation** - Checks if coverage file exists
2. **Badge Generation** - Creates shields.io compatible JSON badges
3. **Report Generation** - Builds formatted markdown coverage report
4. **PR Comment** - Posts report to pull request using GitHub API

### Shell Tools Used

- **`jq`** - JSON parsing and data extraction
- **`bc`** - Mathematical calculations
- **`curl`** - GitHub API communication
- **`bash`** - Scripting and logic

### No More JavaScript Headaches

- ✅ No ESM/CJS confusion
- ✅ No module system warnings
- ✅ No permission issues with git operations
- ✅ No complex dependency management
- ✅ No build/compilation steps
