    "functions": 58.82,
    "lines": 89.82

## Coverage Badges

When `make-badges` is enabled (default: `true`), the action creates a `badges` directory with shields.io compatible JSON files:

### Generated Badges

- `badges/coverage.json` - Overall coverage percentage
- `badges/statements.json` - Statement coverage
- `badges/branches.json` - Branch coverage
- `badges/functions.json` - Function coverage
- `badges/lines.json` - Line coverage

### Badge Colors

- 🟢 **Bright Green**: 90% or higher
- 🟢 **Green**: 80-89%
- 🟡 **Yellow**: 70-79%
- 🟠 **Orange**: 60-69%
- 🔴 **Red**: Below 60%

### Using Badges with GitHub Pages

The action automatically uploads badges to your GitHub Pages branch when `upload-badges-to-pages` is enabled (default: `true`).

1. **Automatic Setup**: The action will:

   - Create the `gh-pages` branch if it doesn't exist
   - Upload badges to the specified directory
   - Commit and push changes automatically

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:

   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select your `gh-pages` branch (or the branch specified in `pages-branch`)
   - Set folder to `/ (root)` or `/badges` depending on your preference

3. **Badge URLs** will be available at:

   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/coverage.json
   https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/statements.json
   https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/branches.json
   https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/functions.json
   https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/lines.json
   ```

4. **Use in your README.md**:
   ```markdown
   ![Coverage](https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/coverage.json)
   ![Statements](https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/statements.json)
   ![Branches](https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/badges/branches.json)
   ```

### Required Permissions

For automatic GitHub Pages upload, your workflow MUST include these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write # For creating/updating PR comments
  contents: write # For uploading badges to GitHub Pages
```

**Without `contents: write` permission, you'll see this error:**

```
Warning: Failed to upload badges to GitHub Pages: Resource not accessible by integration
```

### Troubleshooting

#### "Resource not accessible by integration" Error

This error occurs when the action doesn't have sufficient permissions to create git references or push to branches.

**Solution:** Add the required permissions to your workflow:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: write
```

#### "Branch not found" Error

This error occurs when the action can't find the default branch to create the gh-pages branch from.

**Solution:** Make sure your repository has a default branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the action has `contents: write` permission.
