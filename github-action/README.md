# GitHub Action

This folder contains the GitHub Action for vitest coverage reporting.

## How it works

1. **Reads coverage data** from the JSON file generated by the vitest reporter
2. **Generates a markdown comment** with coverage metrics and visual indicators
3. **Posts/updates the comment** in the pull request

## Files

- `action.js` - The bundled ESM action code (built with ncc)
- `README.md` - This file

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: glideapps/vitest-v8-json-coverage-summary@v1.0.0
```

The action is configured via `action.yml` in the root directory.
